# 🌿 Payung Hijau - First Website Project

**Payung Hijau** is a personal initiative I started to support environmental conservation efforts in Malaysia. As a non-profit concept project, the main mission of Payung Hijau is to **restore deforested and logged areas** across the country and raise awareness about the importance of protecting our biodiversity. This project is inspired by the **15th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): Life On Land**, with a focus on safeguarding the remaining natural landscapes and wildlife of Malaysia.

## 🧭 Project Purpose

With this project, I aim to:

- Highlight the ongoing issues related to deforestation, unsupervised development, and pollution.
- Educate the public on the impacts of habitat destruction through compelling digital storytelling.
- Provide a platform for **Malaysians to donate, volunteer, and share knowledge** about forest conservation.
- Promote small-scale community efforts that contribute to large-scale global impact.

## 💻 Tech Stacks Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML5** – Structure and layout of the website.
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity and dynamic page elements.

The goal was to build a minimalist yet functional website using core front-end technologies with no frameworks, as a way to sharpen my foundational skills.

## 🧠 Personal Development

This project was built as part of my **personal upskilling journey**. I'm constantly exploring ways to improve my abilities in front-end web development, design thinking, and building purpose-driven platforms.

Payung Hijau allows me to:

- Practice clean code structure and responsive web design.
- Create real-world UI/UX aligned with a strong thematic message.
- Understand how to build a user-oriented website with forms, calls-to-action, and visual storytelling.

Ultimately, this is both a **portfolio project** and a **passion project**, combining my interests in tech, sustainability, and community impact.

## ✨ Vision

> “A place to fund energy and money for the greater good.”

This project is my contribution to the conservation of Malaysian rainforests and the protection of native flora and fauna. I believe that change begins with individuals, and through this platform, I hope to inspire others to take part in preserving what’s left of our precious environment.
